### Dozo
Dozo is a data-rich productivity and goal-targeting tool for teams to track their project timelines using Scrum/Agile-based product development practices.

### Progress
> - Launched beta version this past October in Django/Python (see other Dozo repo)
> - Aiming to build an updated version via the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)
> - Key feature to implement will be an admin dashboard for project managers to use to track projects from start to finish
